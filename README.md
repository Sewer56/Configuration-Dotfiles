This repository provides various, mainly visual configurations for software which I run on a regular basis on my laptop accompanying my usual ArchLinux installation. 

The configurations do not use any explicit dotfile manager and are simply deployed in place using GNU Stow, the solution of dotfile management in this way is not perfect but is simple and does exactly what I want it to do.

To the those of you walking by, feel free to pick and match any configurations.
